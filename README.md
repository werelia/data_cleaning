# Data Cleaning

In a data scientist's job, it's important to be able to deal with messy data, whether that means missing values, inconsistent formatting, or malformed records,  which is why I performed this data cleanup. 

I used a fictitious set of customer numbers.

I used a number of useful methods to get the final list of customers who agreed to be contacted:
- I removed the missing data,
- I standardized the column names,
- I removed duplicates and unusful columns,
- I standardized the notation of individual columns,
- I removed clients from the database who do not wish to be contacted.
